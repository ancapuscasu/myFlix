let biography = {
    Name: "Biography",
    Description: "A biopic (short for 'biographical picture') is a type of motion picture that tells the life story of a non-fictional, real person. Biopic films typically revolve around a historical figure or a famous person, though they can be about anyone—as long as the person actually exists or existed in real life. Not all historical dramas or films based on a true story are biopics. A biopic film must focus on one protagonist and comprehensively tell that person's life story over the course of many years (as opposed to just one event or period in that person's life)."

}

let  action = {
    Name: "Action",

let comedy = {
    Name: "Comedy",
